Originally born and raised in the Midwest, Luther moved to the expansive deserts of the American Southwest after 
receiving a Bachelor of the Arts in Computer Science from [Gustavus Adolphus College](https://gustavus.edu/) in Southern Minnesota. 
After moving to Arizona, Luther spent his career building web APIs and utilities for various industries in PHP and NodeJS
before migrating to Open Source DevOps tooling using Containers and Virtualization.

Luther is an Open Source developer mostly writing [Go](https://go.dev/) and working in the Kubernetes space by way of 
his employer [SUSE](https://suse.com/) and their Multi-Cluster Management tool [Rancher](https://rancher.com/). As the 
Team Lead for the [Windows on Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/windows) he has spent time specializing in Kubernetes
working on alternative operating systems and architectures including arm64 and s390x. Working in this
unique space and working from home full time has made him a home lab aficionado and consumer of [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/).
